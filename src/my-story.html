			<h2>How Did I Get Started In Market Research?</h2>

				alt="sunset">
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My journey into the world of market research began during my undergraduate
				studies in Statistics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Initially drawn to the quantitative aspects
				of data, I soon realized that numbers were not just figures on a spreadsheet; they told stories, offered
				insights, and were pivotal in shaping business decisions. It was this revelation that steered my career
				towards market research.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my internships at companies like NetEase
				I was involved in developing online meeting modules and engaging with users on technical forums. This
				experience gave me a firsthand look at how data can be used to enhance user engagement and experience.
				At Procter & Gamble, working as a Marketing Analyst intern, I contributed to the brand positioning of
				Downy. Here, I realized the power of combining statistical analysis with market trends to create
				impactful marketing strategies. As a Marketing & Sales Manager at Datalynn in New York City, I further
				honed my skills, using data to drive effective marketing and sales plans. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Pursuing my Master's in Marketing Communication Research at Boston University was a deliberate choice to
				blend my statistical background with my newfound passion for market research. Leading a project to
				explore market expansion opportunities for Crocs, I orchestrated focus groups and surveys, unraveling
				consumer insights that were both challenging and exhilarating to uncover. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Each step of my journey, from academia to professional roles, has been crucial in shaping my approach to
				market research, transforming it from a field of study into a passion.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm not delving into market research, I enjoy immersing myself in video
				games like Civilization 6 and Zelda, where strategy and adventure captivate my imagination. Painting is
				another passion, allowing me to express creativity and unwind. I love exploring new places, as traveling
				broadens my perspectives and inspires fresh ideas. In the kitchen, I experiment with recipes, finding
				joy and relaxation in cooking. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These hobbies reflect my curiosity,
				creativity, and love for strategic challenges, enriching both my personal and professional life.</p>
